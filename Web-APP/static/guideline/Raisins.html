        <h1>Raisins</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
                Raisins are made primarily by sun drying several different types of grapes. They are small and sweetly flavored with a wrinkled texture. The technique for making raisins has been known since ancient times and evidence of their production has been found in the writings of ancient Egyptians. Currently, over 500 million lb (227 million kg) of raisins are sold each year in the United States, and that number is expected to increase because raisins are recognized as a healthy snack

        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p>
                At temperatures > 25°C and on exposure to mechanical pressure, there is a risk of candying, agglomeration, syrup formation and fermentation. 

                Heat generally causes the risk of discoloration and hardening and the product should thus be stowed away from heat sources.
                
                At temperatures < 10°C, mite growth is inhibited.
