        <p>
                Jarnun prefers to grow under tropical and subtropical climate. It is also found growing in lower ranges of the Himalayas up to an altitude of 1300 meters. The jamun requires dry weather at the time off towering and fruit setting. In subtropical areas, early rain is considered to be beneficial for ripening of fruits and proper development of its size, colour and taste.
