            <h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Botanical name  Cymbopogon flexuosus<br/>
            Common name  Lemon grass<br/>
            It belongs to the family of Gramineae <br/>Three types of lemon
                grasses viz. East Indian lemongrass. West Indian lemon grass (C.citratus), and Jammu lemon
                grass (C.pendulus) are in cultivation in our country as the important sources of cirtral.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2><a name="cli"></a>Geographical distribution</h2>
            <p>C.flexuosus grown commercially in Kerala and nearby adjacent states.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2><a name="land"></a>Uses</h2>
            <p>The chief constituent of the oil is the citral, It is starting material for the preparation of
                important ionone viz., a -lonone  used in flavours, cosmetics and perfume and b
                -Ionone  used in the manufacture of synthetic vitamin A. Oil has bactericidal,
                insect repellent and medicinal uses. The spent grass is a source of good cattle feed and
                can be converted into good silage.<br/><br/>Spent grasses are also
                useful for the manufacture of cardboards and papers or as fuel.</p>

            <h2><a name="app"></a>Package of cultivation practices</h2>
            <p><b>Climate and Soil</b><br/>The plants are hardy
                and grow under a variety of conditions. The most ideal conditions are a warm and humid
                climate with plenty of sunshine and rainfall of 250-280 cm per annum, uniformly
                distributed. Regarding the soil, it can be grown from poor soils, in the hill slopes. Soil
                pH ranging from 4.5 to 7.5 is ideal. As it has good soil binding nature, they can be grown
                as vegetative cover over naked eroded slopes.<br/><br/>
            <b>Varieties </b><br/>The Medicinal and
                Aromatic Plants Research Station, Odakkali (Kerala) and CIMAP, Lucknow has developed
                improved strains viz., OD-19 and SD-68 respectively as a result of breeding and selection.
                The important features of these varieties are given below. These two improved varieties
                are now recommended for wide cultivation. Recently the RRL, Jammu has developed a hybrid
                strain CKP-25 by crossing C.khasianus and C.pendulus which is capable of yielding 50% and
                140% more oil yield than RRL-16 and OD-19 respectively.<br/><br/>
            <b>Nursery</b><br/>The soil should be
                well pulverized for forming the seedbed and it should be a raised bed one. Leaf mould and
                farmyard manure is also added to the soil while forming the bed. 15-20 kg of seeds are
                required for raising seedlings for one hectare. Seeds are sown in lines drawn at 10 cm
                interval in the beds and covered with cut grass materials. When the seedlings are about 2
                months old or about 12 to 15 cm high, they are ready for transplanting. <br/><br/>
            <b>Field preparation</b><br/>
                The land is cleared of
                the underground vegetation and pits of 5 cm cube are made at a spacing of 15 x 10 cm.
                Splits for old clumps can also be used for propagation.<br/><br/>
            <b>Manures and fertilizers</b><br/>The Aromatic Plants
                Research Station Odakkali (Kerala) recommends 100 kg of N/ha. Under North East conditions,
                application of 60kg of N, 50 kg P and 35 kg K is recommended per hectare. In North India,
                Jammu lemon grass (C.pendulus) is cultivated under irrigated condition as a source of
                citral. The cultural practices are almost similar to East India lemon grass. It is
                propagated exclusively by slips, which are planted on flat beds. A spacing of 50 x 50cm is
                adopted. A dose of 260 kg N, 80 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>and 120 kg K<sub>2</sub>O
                per hectare is recommended in 3-4 split doses. The crop responds to irrigation especially
                during hot summer months.<br/><br/>
            <b>Harvesting</b><br/>Lemon grass comes to
                harvest 90 days after planting and subsequently it is harvested at 50-55 days interval.
                The grass is cut 10 cm above the ground level and 5-6 cuttings can be taken in a year
                subject to the climatic conditions. Depending upon the soil and climatic condition, the
                crop can be retained in the field for 5 to 6 years. Depending upon the planting period,
                one or two cuttings are taken in the first year and from second year onwards, 3-4 cuttings
                are available. Harvesting consists of fresh leaves and also the dry or semi-dried leaves
                at intervals of 60 days. The crop should not be allowed to flower profusely as it reduces
                the overall yield.</p>

            <h2><a name="inter"></a>Processing facilities</h2>
            <p>On an average 25 kg of
                oil can be obtained from first year per hectare plantation and about 80 to 100 kg of oil
                per year from first year 2<sup>nd</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> year if well maintained</p>

            <p>Its
                oil is popularly known as "Cochin oil" as it is hiped mainly through Cochin
                port. India is annually producing nearly 1000 MT per year while the world demand is much
                more. Annually, we are exporting lemon grass oil to a tune of about Rs. 5 crores. Our
                country is facing a critical competition from Gautemala in the international market.</p>
