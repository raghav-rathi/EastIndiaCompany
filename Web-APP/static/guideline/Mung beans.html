        <h2><a name="1"></a>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Green gram (<i>Phaseolus aureus Roxb) </i>is important pulse crops<i>. </i>The grains (whole or
        split) are used as a pulse or made into flour, and into straw and husk
        as fodder for cattle. Grains are also eaten whole (after germinating
        them), parched, salted, with sugar or boiled with condiments. The
        important states producing this pulse are Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,
        Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Tamil
        Nadu.<br/></p>

        <div class="row space-clear">
        <h2>Requirement</h2>
        <p><b><a name="2"></a>Climate</b><br/>The crop needs a
        well-distributed rainfall. Heavy rains at flowering are harmful, even
        moist winds at this stage interfere with fertilization.</p>
        <p><b><a name="3"></a>Soil</b>This pulse does best on
        deep, well-drained loams in the alluvial tract in the north as well as
        on the red and black soils of peninsular and southern India. It is also
        cultivated on light or shallow stony soils to clayey soils.</p>

        <h2><a name="5"></a>Cultivation</h2>
        <p>For the pure crop in
        the kharif season, the land is ploughed once or twice and harrowed to
        obtain a rough tilth. The summer crop can be sown dry in furrows in
        between the rows of the previous crop, followed by irrigation.<br/></p>
        </div>
        <div class="row space-clear">
        <h2><a name="6"></a>Sowing</h2>
        <p>The kharif crop is sown
        in June to July, and the rabi crop in September or October. The spring
        crop is to be sown by 15 February and harvested by the middle of May.
        The summer crop is sown by 15 April. The seed may be sown by
        broadcasting or it may be drilled in furrows behind a plough, or with a
        three-or four-coultered desi drill, in rows 20-30cm apart. The seed-rate
        varies from 15-20kg per hectare when sown alone and for mixed crop 2-6kg
        per hectare.<br/></p>
        </div>
        <div class="row space-clear">
        <h2><a name="7"></a>Fertilizer</h2>
        <p>Manuring with 25-40kg
        per ha of phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and 25kg per ha of
        nitrogen (N) should be given at the time sowing. Also seed treatment
        with biofertilizer viz. Rhizobium at the rate of 25gram per kg of seed
        is beneficial.<br/></p>
        </div>
        <div class="row space-clear">
        <h2><a name="8"></a>Irrigation</h2>
        <p>Being kharif crop green
        gram is not required irrigation unless there is dry spell during the
        kharif season. In summer irrigation should be given according to soil
        type. Irrigation interval should be 8-10 days in summer. Flowering and
        pod filling are the critical stages for irrigation.<br/></p>

        <h2>Plant protection</h2>
        <p><strong><a name="9"></a>Pest</strong><br/><b>1. Aphids</b><br/>The nymphs and adults
        suck the sap. The affected leaves turns yellow, get wrinkled and
        distorted. The insect also exude honeydew on which fungus develops,
        rapidly covers the plant with sooty mould that interferes with the
        photosynthetic activity of the plant.<br/><b><a name="10"></a>Control</b><br/>Spraying with 0.05%
        Endosulfan, 0.02% Phosphamidon, 0.03% Dimethoate, Methyl demeton or
        Thiometon control the pest effectively.<br/><br/>
        <b><a name="11"></a>2. Thrips</b><br/>The adults and nymphs
        feed on leaves. They scrape the epidermis and such the oozing sap. As a
        result, light brown patches appear on infested leaves. The affected
        leaves curl and become dry.<br/><b><a name="12"></a>Control</b>Spraying with 0.05%
        Endosulfan, 0.02% Phosphamidon, 0.03% Dimethoate, Methyl demeton or
        Thiometon control the pest effectively.<br/><br/>
        <b><a name="13"></a>3. Pod borer</b><br/>Caterpillars feed on
        tender foliage and young pods. They make holes in the pods and feed on
        developing seeds by inserting anterior half portion of their body inside
        the pods.<br/><b><a name="14"></a>Control</b><br/>In early stage of
        attack handpicking of the caterpillars and their destruction. Ploughing
        fields after the harvest of crop would expose the pupae, which would be
        destroyed by birds. Spraying the crop with 0.05% Quinalphos or
        Fenitrohion can successfully control the pest. Spray with HaNPV @ 250
        LE/ha.<br/>

        spots, with grey or brown centre and reddish-purple border on leave,

        mixture (5:5:50) or 0.2% Ziram.<br/><br/>
        <b><a name="17"></a>2. Powdery mildew</b><br/>White powdery patches
        on leaves and other green parts, later becoming dull coloured and are
        studded with black dot.<br/><b><a name="18"></a>Control</b><br/>Dust the crop with
        finely powdered sulphur (200-mesh) @ 20kg/ha.

        <h2><a name="19"></a>Harvesting and yield</h2>
        <p>To avoid loss because
        of the shattering of pods, the crop is harvested before it is dead ripe.
        One or two rounds of the picking of pods are also recommended to avoid
        losses because of the shattering. The plants are uprooted or cut with a
        sickle, are dried on the threshing-floor for a week or ten days and
        threshed by beating with sticks, and are winnowed with baskets. The
        average yield of grain from a pure crop varieties from 5-6q per ha,
        whereas yields up to 10-15q per ha.<br/></p>
