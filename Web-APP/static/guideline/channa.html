        <h1>Chana</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Chana, one of the major pulses (commonly called daals) cultivated and consumed in India, is also known as Bengal gram or gram or chickpea. Chana is a major and cheap source of protein compared to animal protein. Chana is scientifically known as Cicer aritinum and is reportedly originated from western Asia (Turkey).

In India, main types of chickpea are cultivated viz., Desi and Kabuli in the ratio of 3:1 and chana accounts for about 45% of total pulses produced in the country. Similar to the case of other pulses, India is the major producing country for chana, contributing for over 75% of total production in the world. 
        </p>
        <h2>Economic Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Chana is cultivated for its seeds. They are rich source of protein and form an important part of vegetarian diet. Chana seeds contain about 17-20% of protein
        </p>
        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p> 
            Gram is an important rabi crop mainly sown in September-November and harvested in February. Crop duration is 90-120 days, depending on the variety. Desi varieties are short duration while kabuli varieties take relatively longer period to mature. Similarly, cooler areas like northern India take longer period, compared to relatively warm weather in southern parts of India. It is best suited to areas having low to moderate rainfall and a mild cold weather. Excessive rains soon after sowing or at flowering stage are harmful for the crop. Severe cold is injurious, and is very harmful. It is best suited to areas having moderate rainfall of 60-90 cm per annum. It has an indeterminate growth habit, which means that the growth cycle extends as long as moisture is available.
