                    <p>Fenugreek, a native of South Eastern Europe and West Asia, is cultivated as a leafy vegetable, condiment and as
                        medicinal plant. The fresh tender leaves and stem are consumed as curried vegetable and
                        the seeds are mainly used as spice for flavoring almost all dishes. It has a high
                        medicinal value as it prevents constipation, removes indigestion, stimulates spleen and
                        liver and is appetizing and diuretic. </p>

                        major states growing fenugreek in India are Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar
                        Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab.</p></td></tr>
                    <tr><td style="border:0; padding-top:0px;"><p>It is an annual herb
                        reaching a height of about 0.9 m, leaves are light green, pinnately trifoliate, flowers
                         papilionaceous, fruits  legume, long, narrow, curved, tapering with a slender
                        point and containing small deeply furrowed seeds. There are two species of the genus
                        Trigonella, which are of economic importance viz., T.foenum graecum, the common methi and
                        T.corniculata, the Kasuri methi. These two differ in their growth habit and yield. The
                        latter one is a slow growing type and remains in rosette condition during most of its
                        vegetative growth period. </p></td>

                    <p>It has a wide adaptability and is successfully cultivated both in the tropics as well as temperate
                        regions. It is tolerant to frost and freezing weather. It does well in places receiving
                        moderate or low rainfall areas but not in heavy rainfall area. It can be grown on a wide
                        variety of soils but clayey loam is relatively better. The optimum soil pH should be 6.0
                        to 7.0 for its better growth and development. </p>

                    <h2>Land preparation and sowing</h2>
                    <p>Land is prepared by ploughing thrice and beds of uniform size are prepared. Broadcasting the seed in the bed
                        and raking the surface to cover the seeds is normally followed. But, line sowing is
                        advocated in rows at 20 to 25 cm apart which facilitates the intercultural operations. <br/><br/>Sowing in the plains
                        is generally taken up in September to November while in the hills, it is grown from March.
                        Approximately 20 to 25 kg of seed is required for one hectare and the seed takes about 6-8
                        days to complete its germination.</p>

                    <h2>Manures and fertilizers</h2>
                    <p>Besides 15 tonnes of farm yard manure, a fertilizer dose of 25 kg Nitrogen, 25 kg Phosphorus and 50 kg Potash
                        per ha is recommended. Half of the nitrogen dose and the entire quantity of phosphorus and
                        potash are applied basally and the remaining half Nitrogen is applied 30 days after
                        sowing. To obtain more successful leafy growth, nitrogen should be applied after each
                        cutting.</p>

                    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
                    <p>In about 25 to 30 days, young shoots are nipped off 4 to 5 cm above ground level and subsequent cuttings of
                        leaves may be taken after 15 days. It is advisable to take 1 to 2 cuttings before the crop
                        is allowed for flowering and fruiting. When pods are dried, the plants are pulled out,
                        dried in the sun and seeds are threshed by beating with stick or by rubbing with hands.
                        Seeds are winnowed, cleaned and dried in the sun. They may be stored in gunny bags lined
                        with paper.</p>
