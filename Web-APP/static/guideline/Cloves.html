                        unopened flower buds of the evergreen tree, <i>Syzygium aromaticum</i>, (Syn. <i>Eugenia
                        caryophyllus</i>) is an important spices noted for its flavour and medicinal values. It is
                        indigenous to Moluccas island (Indonesia) and was introduced to India around 1800 A.D. by
                        the East Indian Company in their spice garden in Courtallam, Tamil Nadu. The major
                        producers of this spice today are Indonesia, Zanzibar and Madagascar. World production is
                        estimated to be 63,700 tonnes. Indonesia alone accounts for 66 % of the world production.
                        The important clove growing regions in India now are the Nilgiris, Tirunelveli and
                        Kanyakumari districts of Tamil Nadu, Calicut, Kottayam, Quilon and Trivandrum districts of
                        Kerala and South Kanara district of Karnataka. </font></p>

                        industry uses both whole and ground form of cloves in various preparations. Clove oil is
                        used in perfumeries, pharmaceuticals and flavouring industries. Clove oleoresin is also
                        increasingly used in the food processing industry. In Indonesia, the major part is
                        absorbed for making KRETEK cigarette industry. The clove is an evergreen tree often
                        reaching a height of 7 to 15 metres. Leaves posses plenty of oil glands on the lower
                        surface. </font></p>

                    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Clove is strictly a
                        tropical plant and requires a warm humid climate having a temperature of 20 to 30<sup>0</sup>C.
                        Humid atmospheric condition and a well distributed annual rainfall of 150 to 250 cm are
                        essential. It thrives well in all situations ranging from sea level upto an altitude of
                        1500 metres and also in places proximal to and away from sea. Deep black loam soil with
                        high humus content found in the forest region is best suited for clove cultivation. It
                        grows satisfactorily on laterite soils, clay loams and rich black soils having good
                        drainage. Sandy soil is not suitable. </font></p>

                    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Clove is propagated
                        through seed, which is called mother clove. The seeds become available from June to
                        October. Fruits are allowed to ripe on the tree itself and drop down naturally. Such fruit
                        are collected from the ground and sown directly in nursery or soaked in water overnight
                        and the pericarp removed before sowing. They lose their viability within one week after
                        harvest under normal conditions and hence they must be sown immediately after collection
                        from a tree. The second method gives quicker and higher germination. Big sized seeds
                        generally give higher percent of germination. </font></p>

                        are of 15 to 20 cm height, one metre width and a convenient length. The beds should be
                        made of loose soils and over which a layer of sand may be spread (about 5-8cm thick).
                        Seeds are sown at 2 to 3 cm spacing and a depth of about 2cm. The seedbeds have to be
                        protected from direct sunlight. The germination commences in about 10 to 15 days and may
                        last for about 40 days. In higher elevations, germination is delayed considerably, often
                        requires 60 days. The germinated seedlings are transplanted in polythene bags 30cm x 15
                        cm) containing a mixture of good soil, sand and well decomposed cowdung (in the ratio of
                        about 3:3:1). The seedlings are ready for transplanting in the field when they are 18 to
                        24 months old. The nurseries are usually shaded and irrigated daily to ensure uniform
                        stand. </font></p>

                        pits of 60 to 75 cm 3 are dug at a spacing of 6 to 7 meters. The pits are partially filled
                        with topsoil. The seedlings are transplanted in the main field during the beginning of
                        rainy seasons, in June-July, and in low lying areas, towards the end of the monsoon, in
                        September-October. Cloves prefer partial shade. </font></p>

                        after about 15 to 20 years. The flowering season is September-October in the plains and
                        December to February at high altitudes. Flower buds are produced on young flush. It takes
                        about 4 to 6 months for the buds to become ready for harvest. At this time, they are less
                        than 2cm long. The optimum stage for picking clove buds is indicated by the change in the
                        colour from green to slightly pinkish tinge. The matured clove buds are carefully picked
                        with hand. Care should be taken to pick the buds at the correct time, as otherwise the
                        quality of the cured produce will be lost to a considerable extent. When the trees are
                        tall and the clove bunches are beyond the reach, platform ladders are used for harvesting.
                        Bending the branches or knocking down the bud clusters with sticks is not desirable as
                        these practices affect the future bearing of the tree.</font></p>
