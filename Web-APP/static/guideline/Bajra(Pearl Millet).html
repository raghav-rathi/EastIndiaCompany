                <div class="row space-clear">
                <h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction:</h2>
                <p>Bajra popularly known as Pearl millet, cattail millet or bulrush belongs to the family Graminea.
                    The crop is cultivated for grain as well as for fodder in the arid region of Africa and
                    Asia and as a pasture in U.S.A. It is originated in India or Africa. It is grown all over
                    India except Assam and part of northeast India.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="row space-clear">
                <h2><a name="cli"></a>Climate and soil:</h2>
                <p>The crop has a wide adaptability as it may grow under different day lengths, temperature and
                    moisture stress. Most of the varieties developed in India are photosensitive which helps
                    in growing the crop during monsoon, rabi and arid season. It requires low annual rainfall
                    ranging between 40-50 cm and dry weather. The crop may tolerate drought but cannot
                    withstand high rainfall of 90 cm or above. Light soils of low inherent fertility good
                    drainage, mild salinity are best type for this crop. Crop does not tolerate soil acidity</p>
                </div>
                <div class="row space-clear">
                <h2><a name="land"></a>Land preparation:</h2>
                <p>The crop needs very fine tilt because the seeds are too small. 2-3 harrowings and a ploughing
                    is followed so that a fine tilth may be obtained to facilitate the sowing and proper
                    distribution of seed at appropriate depth. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="row space-clear">
                <h2><a name="varie"></a>Varieties: </h2>
                <p>NBH-149, VBH-4 developed for Andhra Pradesh,
                    Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra are capable of producing 14% higher yield.<br/>
                    ICM4-155 gave higher yield than the standard check and adopted for all growing tracts of
                    India.Also H-306, NH-338 and hybrid like MP-204, MP205 have been identified.</p>

                <h2><a name="sow"></a>Sowing</h2>
                <p>Sowing time :- Most appropriate time
                    of sowing is middle or last week of July<br/>
                    Seed rate and Spacing:- <br/>
                    4-5 kg/ha for drilling method<br/>
                    2.5-3 kg/ha for dibbling method<br/>
                    spacing 40 45 cm between rows, 10 15 cm within rows.<br/>
                    Seed treatment- The organo-mercurial compound Ceresan, Agrosan should be used @ 2.5-3
                    kg/ha to control seed borne diseases</p>
                <p>Generally the crop requires low quantity of nutrients. But All India Co-ordinated Millet
                    Improvement Project has proved that new plant types of bajra especially hybrids respond to
                    very high doses of fertilizers.<br/><br/>Under rainfed areas
                    application of organic manures such as FYM or compost helps in increasing the crop yield
                    at the rate of 150-200 quintals/ha 80 100 kg N:40-50 kgP:40-50kgK is recommended
                    dose for hybrid variety. <br/><br/>Fertilizers are
                    applied in split doses, half of nitrogen, full phosphorus and potash should be basal
                    placed at the time of sowing . The organic manures must be applied 20 days before the
                    sowing of the seeds for full decomposition. One fourth dose of nitrogen should be applied
                    about 30 days and 60 days after sowing.</p>

                <h2><a name="iner"></a>Interculture</h2>
                <p>Thinning or gap filling is followed at the time of first interculture. Hand weeding is followed to
                    control the weeds or application of Atrazine @ 0.5 kg/ha would take care of most of the
                    weeds.</p>

                <h2><a name="irri"></a>Irrigation:</h2>
                <p>Bajra is grown rainfed and crop being drought resistant hardly needs any irrigation, however it
                    is observed that the yield may be significantly increased by irrigating the crop at
                    critical growth stages like maximum tillering, flowering and grain filling stage.
                    Therefore light irrigations and efficient drainage is very essential for bajra production.</p>

                <h2><a name="plant"></a>Plant protection measures</h2>
                <p><strong>a) Insect pests:</strong><br/> Stem bores and
                    grasshoppers are serious pests of bajra controlled by two sprayings with 2 litres of
                    Eldrin 20 c.c and grasshoppers may be controlled by dusting the crop with BHC 5 percent.<br/><br/>
                <strong>b) Diseases: </strong><br/>
                    Downy mildew- for controlling this disease
                    seed treatment with fungicide like Dithane Z-78 or M-45 @ 2.0kg/ha in 800-1000 lit. of
                    water.<br/>
                    Smut- Treatment with Ceresan or Thirum @ 1-2 g/kg seeds is effective.<br/>
                    Ergot- Seed treatment with 20% common salt solution followed by washing with fresh water
                    and then treating with Ceresan or Thirum @ 1-2 g/kg seeds is effective</p>

                <h2><a name="harvest"></a>Harvesting and Storage:</h2>
                <p><strong>Harvesting and threshing:</strong><br/>The crop is harvested when grains become
                    hard enough and contain moisture. Two methods are adopted for harvesting the crop Cutting earhead<br/>i) from standing crop followed by cutting of remaining plants later <br/>
                    ii) Cutting of entire plants by sticks and stalking the plants for five days in sun
                    for obtaining grains. Grains are separated either by beating the earheads with sticks or
                    by trampling the earheads under bullock feet.<br/><br/>
                <strong> Storage:</strong><br/> The separated grains must be cleaned and dried in sun to bring about 12-14%
                    moisture after which the grains may be bagged and stored in a moisture proof store.<br/><br/>
                <strong>Yield:</strong> Irrigated crop yields 30-35 quintals/ha, while unirrigated crop yield 12-15
                    quintals/ha</p>
