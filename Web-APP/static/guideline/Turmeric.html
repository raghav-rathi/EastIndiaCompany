            <h2><a name="1"></a><b>Introduction</b></h2>
            <p>Turmeric is the dried rhizome of <i>Curcuma longa, </i>a herbaceous plant. The rhizome has 1.8-5.4% <i>curcumin,
                </i>the pigment and 2.5-7.2% of essential oil. It is used as an important condiment and as
                a dye with varied applications in drug and cosmetic industries. In India, Andhra Pradesh
                is the leading state followed by Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Kerala and Bihar.</p>

                can be grown from sea level to 1500m in the hills, at a temperature range of 20-30<sup>0</sup>C
                with a rainfall of 1500-2250mm per annum. It is also grown as an irrigated crop.<br/><br/>

            <h2><a name="5"></a> material and planting</h2>
            <p>The areas where the rainfall is sufficiently early, crop can be planted during April-May with
                the receipt of pre-monsoon showers. Since turmeric is a shade loving plant, castor or <i>Sesbania
                grandiflora </i>may be raised along the border lines in the field. Well developed healthy
                and disease free whole or split mother rhizomes weighing 35-44g are used for planting.
                Rhizomes are treated with 0.3% Dithane M-45 and 0.5% Malathion for 30 minutes before
                storing. Small pits are made with a hand hoe in the beds in rows with a spacing of 25x 30
                cm and covered with soil or dry powdered cattle manure. The optimum spacing in furrows and
                ridges is about 45-60 cm between the rows and 25 cm between the plants. A seed rate of
                2500kg of rhizomes are required for one hectare.</p>

                is given as basal dose at the time planting while Nitrogen (N) is applied as 25kg each at
                basal, 30,60,90 and 120 days after planting i.e., 125kg N.</p>

                sugarcane trash at the rate of 12-15 tonnes per hectare. It may be repeated for second
                time after 50 days with the same quantity of green leaves after weeding and application of
                fertilizers. Weeding may be done thrice at 60,120and 150 days after planting depending

            <h2><a name="20"></a>Harvesting</h2>
            <p>Depending upon the variety, the crop becomes ready for harvest in seven to nine months. The land is
                ploughed and the rhizomes are gathered by hand picking or the clumps are carefully lifted
                with a spade. Harvested rhizomes are cleaned of mud and other extraneous matter adhering
                to them. The average yield per hectare is 20-25 tonnes of green turmeric.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
            <h2>Processing</h2>
            <p><span><a name="21"></a><strong>Curing</strong></span><br/>The fresh turmeric is
                cured before marketing. Curing involves boiling of fresh rhizomes in water and drying in
                the sun. The mother rhizomes and the fingers are generally cured separately In the
                traditional method, the cleaned rhizomes are boiled in copper or galvanized iron or
                earthen vessels, with water just enough to soak them. Boiling is stopped when froth comes
                out and white fumes appear giving out a typical odour. The boiling lasts for 45-60 minutes
                when the rhizomes are soft. In the improved scientific method of curing the cleaned
                fingers (approximately 50kg) are taken in a perforated trough of size 0.9 X 0.55x0.4m,
                made of GI or MS sheet with extended parallel handle. The perforated trough containing the
                lingers are then immersed in the pan. The alkaline solution (0.1% sodium carbonate or
                sodium bicarbonate) is poured into the trough to immerse the turmeric fingers. The whole
                mass is boiled till the fingers become soft. The cooked fingers are taken out of the pan
                by lifting the trough and draining the solution into the pan. The cooking of turmeric is
                to be done within two to three days after harvesting. The cooked fingers are dried in the
                sun by spreading 5-7 cm thick layers on bamboo mat or drying floor. During night time, the
                materials should be heaped or covered. Drying is completed in 10-15 days.<br/><br/>
            <span><a name="22"></a><strong>Polishing</strong></span><br/>The appearance is improved by smoothening and polishing outer surface by manual or mechanical
                rubbing. The improved method is by using hand operated barrel or drum mounted on a central
                axis, the sides of which are made of expanded metal mesh. When the drum filled with
                turmeric is rotated at 30 rpm, polishing is effected by abrasion of the surface against
                the mesh as well as by mutual rubbing against each other as they roll inside the drum. The
                turmeric is also polished in power-operated drums. The yield of polished turmeric from the
                raw materials varies from 15-25%. <br/><br/>
            <span><a name="23"></a><strong>Colouring</strong></span><br/>In order to impart attractive yellow colour, turmeric suspension in water is added to the
                polishing drum in the last 10 minutes. Composition of emulsion for colour coating of 100kg
                of half boiled turmeric is Alum 0.04kg, turmeric powder 2kg, castor seed oil 0.14kg,
                sodium bisulphate 30g, concentrated hydrochloric acid 30ml. When the rhizomes are
                uniformly coated with suspension, they may be dried in the sun.
