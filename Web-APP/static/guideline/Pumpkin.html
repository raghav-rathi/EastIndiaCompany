        <h1>Pumpkin</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
                A pumpkin is a cultivar of a squash plant, most commonly of Cucurbita pepo, that is round, with smooth, slightly ribbed skin, and most often deep yellow to orange in coloration.[1] The thick shell contains the seeds and pulp. Some exceptionally large cultivars of squash with similar appearance have also been derived from Cucurbita maxima. Specific cultivars of winter squash derived from other species, including C. argyrosperma, and C. moschata, are also sometimes called "pumpkin".[1]

        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p>
                Basically, Pumpkins are the very warm vegetable, which can also resist in cold temp. Because of plentiful uses and benefits of Pumpkins fruits, are cultivated all over the world. There are many types of Pumpkins, that can grow in various types of climatic conditions.

                However, a temp. ranging between 20 °C to 30 °C is considered as the ideal temp. for growing pumpkins for its best vegetative growth. 
                
                Note that growing pumpkins in too hot and in the too cool region is not beneficial because Pumpkins plants are very sensitive to frost conditions and pumpkins seeds do not grow well in the cold soil. Also, at higher atmospheric temp. sometimes male flowers predominant on the female flowers, resulting as lower fruits production in that season.
