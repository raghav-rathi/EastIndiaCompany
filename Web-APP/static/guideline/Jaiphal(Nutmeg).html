Botanical name of Nutmeg is Myristica fragrans. In Hindi, it is known as ‘jaiphal’. Nutmeg is a dioecious, perennial plant. Nutmeg is an evergreen, conical tree reaching a height of about 10 meters. Nutmeg is grown for nutmeg kernels and mace. Commercial nutmeg is the dried kernel of seed, whereas mace is dried aril surrounding the seeds. Warm, humid climate is most suitable for nutmeg cultivation. Nutmeg grows well up to 1,300m above mean sea-level and with an annual rainfall of 150 cm or more.

Andaman and Nicobar islands has got one of the best tropical and sub-tropical climate with good rainfall which is much suited for nutmeg cultivation. The area under nutmeg cultivation here is 21 ha. with a total production of 31,5000 Nos. of nutmeg. We can very much increase the production of nutmeg by practicing scientific cultural practices and also taking nutmeg as an intercrop in the existing arecanut and coconut gardens.
