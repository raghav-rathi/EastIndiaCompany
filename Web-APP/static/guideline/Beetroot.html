        <h1>Beetroot</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
                Farming beetroot is a simple method complare to other commercial crop as it does not needs to much care & management. It can be easily grown in home gardens as well as in the poly houses & in the green houses, mainly for its fleshy enlarged roots. The garden beet is different from the sugar beet, where the emphasis is laid more on the sugar content of the roots. Whereas the garden beet is used for salad and cooked vegetable purposes.

        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p>
                If climate support, then any one with high yielding cultivar can produce an expected amount of beet production. So, for getting a higher yield, check whether is your climate condition support a well or not to your beet cultivation for selected beet cultivar. Since agro-climatic factor is also a major factor that decides the beet production.

Beet thrives their best in a cool climate condition as beets are cool weather & hardy crop. A temp. ranging from 17 ‘C to 28 ‘C is considered as the best for good development of root. They can be cultivated through out the complete year but winter is the best for its cultivation. Beets grown in relatively higher temp has a poor quality of root like are light in color & low in sugar content. So, it is better to plant them in the winter season or in Monsoon season to obtain quality roots from its cultivation which are high in sugar content, sweet in the taste along with intense internal color.

Extended cold conditions lead to slower development of beet roots. Also, an excessive hot weather leads to some disorder in roots like Zoning. Zoning in beets means theirs appears succeeding, concentric circles with dark & light red color in the roots. Beets are able to develop well in the warmer season but no in excessive hot, it will lesson you root quality which is not able to give you any profit
