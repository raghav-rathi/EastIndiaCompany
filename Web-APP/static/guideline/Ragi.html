                    <p>Finger millet, Eleusine coracana L., is also known as African millet, koracan, ragi (India). It
                        is an important staple food in parts of eastern and central Africa and India. It is an
                        important cereal in Karnataka. It is extensively grown in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra
                        pradesh, Orissa, Bihar, Gujrat and Maharashtra and in the hilly regions of Uttar Pradesh
                        and himachal Pradesh, with a total area of 2.5 million hectares and 2.2 million tonnes of
                        production. <br/><br/>The height of cultivars varies from 40 cm to I m and the spike length
                        ranges from 3 to 13 cm. The colour of grains may vary from white through orange-red deep
                        brown and purple, to almost black. The grains are smaller than those of pearl millet, and
                        the mean I 000-seed weight is about 2.6 g. </p>

                    <p>Ragi may be grown as a hot weather crop, from May to September, using long duration varieties
                        and as a cold season crop, from November and December, using early types. Ragi is
                        monocropped in India under irrigation or transplantation. Rainfed it is mostly
                        intercropped with cereals, castor bean, niger, groundnut and pulses. The most common
                        subsidiary crops grown with ragi are fieldbean (Lablab purpureus), pigeon pea (Cajanus
                        cajan), cowpea (Vigna sinensis), and niger (Guizotia abysinnica). With groundnuts, ragi is
                        the subsidiary crop. Liberal manure, mainly sheep and cattle, is applied. Green manures
                        such as cowpeas, sunnhemp, artificial manures and oil cakes, have been used on both
                        irrigated and unirrigated crops. Ragi is chopped and weeded at intervals of 14 days or so.
                        The number and frequency of irrigations varies with seasonal conditions. </p>

                    <h2><a name="harvest"></a>Harvesting and Yields :</h2>
                    <p>Ragi matures 3-5 months after sowing, depending on variety, season and soil properties. Rainfed
                        crops are cut close to ground, stalks are allowed to wither for a day or two in field, and
                        then bundled and stacked for about 2 months before threshing. To separate the grains,
                        dried earheads are beaten with sticks, sheaves are trodden by bullocks or crushed by stone
                        rollers. The average yield of the rain-fed crop ranges from 10 to 15 q/ha, whereas the
                        irrigated crop yields up to 40 or 50 q/ha. The fodder yield ranges from 30-90 q/ha in the
                        case of the late groups.</p>
