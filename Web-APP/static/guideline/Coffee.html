            <h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>Coffee (<i>Coffea arabica </i>and<i> c.robusta )</i> cultivation is mainly confined to the
                    States of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and on a limited scale to
                    Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Orissa,
                    Sikkim, Tiruprua and West Bengal. Coffee cultivation is confined mostly to the hilly
                    tracts of Western and Eastern Ghats.</p>

            <p>Climatic requirements for <i>arabica</i> and <i>robusta</i> are as follows<br/><br/>Arabica can
                    planted at elevation1000-1500m from mean sea level and annual rainfall 1600-2500mm.it
                    requires optimum temperature 15-25<sup>0</sup>C and relative humidity 70-80%and needs
                    medium to light shade. While robusta can planted at elevation 500-1000m from mean sea
                    level and annual rainfall 1000-2000mm.it requires optimum temperature 20-30<sup>0</sup>C
                    and relative humidity 80-90%and needs uniform thin shade.<br/>
                    Soil should be deep, friable well drained, slightly acidic in reaction (PH 6.0-6.5) porous
                    and rich in organic matter content. Soil should be moisture retentive.. </p>

            <h2><a name="Land Preparation"></a>Land Preparation</h2>
            <p>The land should be divided into blocks of convenient size with footpath and roads laid out inbetween. In steapy area,
                    terracing and contour planting may also be adopted. Spacing for arabica and robusta coffee
                    is 2-2.5m and 2.5 to 4m respectively on either way. Pits of 45cm are usually opened after
                    the first few summer shower and seedlings of 16to18months old are planted during June or
                    September-October. The seedling is placed in the hole with its taproot and lateral roots
                    spread out in proper position. The soil around the seedling is packed firmly and evenly in
                    such a way that 3-cm high above the ground to prevent stagnation of water around the
                    collar. The seedlings are provided with cross stakes to prevent wind damage.</p>

            <h2><a name="Management practices"></a>Management practices</h2>
            <p><strong>Training</strong><br/><b>Single stem system</b>When the
                    plant reaches a height of 75cm in Arabica or 110-120 cm in robusta, is topped. This
                    facilitates lateral spreading and increases the bearing area. In this system, a second
                    tier is also allowed sometimes depending upon the soil fertility and plants vigour.<br/><br/>
            <b>Pruning</b><br/>Pruning in Coffee is done immediately after harvest and till the onset of monsoon. Pruning involves: -<br/>A centering - removal of the vegetative growth upto 15 cm radius from the center and upto the
                    first node of all primary branches<br/>Desuckering - removal of orthotropic branches arising from the main trunk<br/>Handling - removal of small sprouts arising from the axis of the leaves which otherwise grow towards
                    the inner side and cause shade and become unproductive wood and<br/>Nipping- growing tip of primary branches is removed to encourage secondary and tertiaries. </p>

            <p><strong>Digging</strong><br/>In the new clearing, the field is given a thorough digging to a depth about 35-45cm towards the end of the monsoon. Once the coffee plants have closed in, annual digging is not done,.<br/><br/><strong>Scuffling or soil stirring</strong><br/>In established coffee fields, scuffling or soil stirring is done towards the beginning of the dry period. In controls weeds and also conserves soil moisture.<br/><br/><strong>Trenching</strong><br/>Trenches and pits are dug or renovated in a staggered manner between rows of coffee along the contour during August-October when the soil is fairly easy to work. These are 50cm wide and 25cm deep and can be of any convenient length.<br/><br/><strong>Mulching</strong><br/>Mulching young coffee clearings helps to maintain optimum soil temperature and conserves soil moisture and acts as an effective erosion control measures</p>

            <p>The peak periods of demands for nutrients are at the time of flowering, fruit set and development and maturation of the crop. Based on all these factors. For coffee, fertilizer schedule is as follows:</p>

            <h2><a name="Shade and its management"></a>Shade and its management</h2>
            <p>Under the climatic condition existing in India, coffee is being cultivated under shade. It comprises of two canopise-lower or temporary and upper or permanent. Dadap is used as a lower canopy shade in India. When stakes are planted in June, they grow quickly using the moisture available in the soil. Silver oak is the most commonly used tree for temporary shade. Permanent shade trees are generally planted about 12-14 metres apart. The trees have to be regulated
                    in such a way that they have their canopy about 10-14 metres above the coffee. Shade trees
                    require constant attention by way of pruning and lopping to provide the required filtered
                    shade to coffee. The Dadap are lopped 2-3 times a year to regulate the light requirements
                    according to season. Dadap is lopped at the commencement of the south west monsoon to
                    allow more light and regulated during winter when the dry weather begins. In north east
                    monsoon area, it is lopped during August-September.</p>

            <h2><a name="harvest"></a>Harvesting and Storage</h2>
            <p>Coffee fruits should be
                    picked as and when they become ripe to get better quality. Arabica comes for harvesting
                    earlier since they take 8-9 months for fruit development from flowering while robusta
                    takes 10-11 months. Picking is done by hand. The first picking consists of selective
                    picking of ripe berries and is called fly picking. Thereafter, there will be 4-6 main
                    pickings at 10-15days intervals and final harvest.</p>
