        <h1>Jackfruit</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
                Originally, jackfruit is a native of India and presently cultivated throughout the tropical low land in both the hemispheres. It is commonly grown in Burma and Malaysia and to a certain extent in Brazil.

                Wild jackfruit is found in Western Ghats of India. In India, jackfruit plantation is mostly done in Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Orissa, Kerela and Tamil Nadu. Its regular plantations are found only in U.P. where marginal orchards exist.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p>
                Proper Jackfruit plantation requires rich and well drained sandy loam soil. Soil drainage is of great importance to jack fruit as is evidenced by the sudden decline of numerous trees in the areas suffering from a sudden rise of water level.

Jack fruit tree can not tolerate moisture stress but presence of lime and chlorine is tolerable to some extent. Areas near the river beds are ideally suitable for its cultivation.

Warm humid plains are suitable for jack fruit cultivation and it flourishes in humid hill slopes up to an elevation of 1,500 meters. Quality of fruit deteriorates in higher altitudes but grows satisfactorily in arid and warm plains of South India.

Cold weather and frost are harmful to its cultivation. Hot desiccating winds in summer also adversely affect the growth of trees
