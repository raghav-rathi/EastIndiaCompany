        <h1>Ridgegourd</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
                Ridge gourds (Luffa acutangula) belong to the Cucurbit family. These annual vines are grouped with summer squash and produce fruit with ridges that run lengthwise along the skin. Fruit is often thin and curved. This edible Luffa gourd is found in grocery stores, but you can also grow the ridge gourd in the home garden. Its climate and soil needs are similar to other gourds.

        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p>
                All gourds, including ridge gourds, are warm-season crops. They require as much summer heat as they can get to produce fruit before the first fall frost. You should wait to plant gourd seeds until the danger of frost passes in the spring. Gourd seeds planted in soil that is wet or too cold, below 60 degrees F, cannot germinate successfully. Ridge gourds have a long growing season of 100 to 180 frost-free days until harvest. If you live in an area with short growing season, you can start seeds indoors four weeks prior to transplanting outdoors.
