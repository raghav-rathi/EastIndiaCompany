            <h2>Tamarind</h2>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Tamarind (Tamarindus
                indica L) is one of the common fruit trees found grown all over India mostly under rainfed
                conditions, particularly in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya
                Pradesh and Orissa. It is also one of the most popular avenue trees which yield useful
                fruits and timber besides providing shade. Tamarind is believed to be native of Tropical
                Africa but now cultivated throughout South East Asia, Australia, America.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Importance- Tamarind
                fruit is an important condiment/ adjunct used as an acidic/ flavouring agent in the Indian
                cookery. India produces about 2.5 lakh tonnes of Tamarind pulp annually. Pulp powder and
                juice concentrates have a export potential in European countries. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Tamarind pulp has an
                excellent keeping quality when dried properly in and cured with salt. Pulp is rich in
                glucose (47.7% of total sugar); D-manose (24.5%) and D-maltose (20.4%). The sour taste of
                the pulp is attributed to Tartaric acid  (8-18%) together with malic and citric acids
                (2%) . The fruit is good source of phosphorus, calcium and iron. Tender leaves and flowers
                are also edible. Tamarind seeds yield a cheap substitute for cereal starch which is in
                textile industry.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Climatic: Tamarind
                tree has a acid climatic adaptability and can be grown in humid to dry hot regions. It is
                very sensitive to frost. The optimum rainfall requirement is 750-1900mm, but can thrive in
                region with low annual rainfall of 500-750mm.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Soil: It can thrive on
                variety of soils, but deep loamy or alluvial soils providing optimum condition for
                development of its long tap roots are ideal. It can tolerate slightly saline and alkaline
                soils.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Varieties: There are
                very few well recognized tamarind varieties. However, in the recent past few seedling
                selections have been identified on the basis of fruit quality and yield. These are:
                Prathisthan from Fruit Research station, Aurangabad, Tree No 38 located at college of
                Agriculture, Pune, (Maharashtra) A high yielding type PKM- 1 has been developed by
                Coimbtore Agril. University (Tamil Nadu)</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Propagation: Common
                method of propagation in vogue is by seed. However, being heterozygtes, it does not breed
                true to type through seed. The prolonged juvenile phase is also due to predominance of
                seed propogation. Seedlings Trees about 15-20 years for economic yields. Vegetatively
                propagated plants start yielding after 3-4 years. Vegetative methods such as approach
                grafting, air layering and budding have been successful. However, layers are suitable for
                planting under dryland conditions for lack of deep growing tap root system. In order to
                obtain true to type plants with reduced pre-bearing age, uniform growth and yield
                vegetative methods like budding and grafting be used in establishing Tamarind orchards.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Planting: In order to
                provide space and proper medium for development of vigourous and deep tap root system
                planting should be done in pits of 1 x 1 x 1m size. The pits should be dug during summer
                and filled in with 2 kg single superphosphate at the base and with a mixture of well
                decomposed Farm yard manure and top soil. About 100g 10 per cent carbanyl powder be mixed
                in the soil mixture to avoid the problem of termites. The planting distance may vary from
                8 X 8 to 10 X 10m depending on the soil type, closer spacing in shallow soils and wider
                spacing in deep soils be adopted Rootstock seedlings be planted in situ during monsoon
                (June-July) and budded by patched method using a bud from improved variety.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Interculturing:
                Interculture operations like weeding, hoeing be carried out regularly. Cover crops like
                cowpea, horse gram etc, may be grown during rainy season to control weeds, check soil
                erosion and improve soil health.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Inter crops like
                drumstick or low growing vegetables can be grown during initial 4-5 years to get early
                returns.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Care of young
                Orchards; Young plants be provided support of bamboo stick and irrigated during dry spell
                particularly summer months upto 3-4 years of planting.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">In the initial years
                ,training is very essential to develop the farm work .The plant be trained to modify
                leader system. Shoots appearing from root stock and weak and diseased or dried branches be
                punned</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Special Horticulture
                practices: Tamarind is a semiforest tree and does not need any special treatment as it is
                adapted to a wide range of soil and agro climatic conditions .</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Irrigation: Tamarind
                is a dry land (rainfed) crop and hence it is normally not irrigated. But young orchards
                needs to be irrigated, especially during dry spells and summer months. One year old plants
                be given 10 litres water at an interval of 6-8 days during summer which may be doubled
                during 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> year. There after irrigation may not be
                necessary. However if it is provided growth will be faster and better</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Nutrition: Nutritional
                requirement of Tamarind have not been studied so far and standardized recommendations are
                not available. On an adhoc basis one year old tree should receive 10 kg FYM + 100 g N +
                50g P<sub>2</sub>o<sub>5</sub> + 100g K<sub>2</sub>o  and the dose be increased with
                age. Thus , a 10 year old tree should receive 50 kg FYM +1 kg N + 500 g P<sub>2</sub>o<sub>5</sub>
                 + 1 kg K<sub>2</sub>o. If irrigation is available additional 500 g N be given in the
                month of September-October. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Plant protection:
                There are hardly any pests and diseases on Tamarind plant. So far no serious pests and
                diseases have been reported. Nor any systematic studies have been undertaken on this plant
                as it grows mostly under semiwild conditions. The plant has developed natural resistance
                against this maladies and hence requires hardly any plant protection measures.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Harvesting and yield:
                Seed propagated plants start bearing 7-8 years after planting. While grafted or budded
                plants will start fruiting 4-5 years of planting. Fruits are harvested during
                January-April months. The yield varies with soil type, climate, propagation method and
                management practices. A well managed tree yield 300-500 kg ripe pods.</font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Post  harvest
                handling and marketing: After harvest pods are spread on ground and cut for 6-7 days . The
                shell and seeds as well as the fibrous material is removed and the pulp is collected , the
                pulp can be stored for a period of 6-12 months after properly drying in the sun. Many a
                times trees or entire plantation is auctioned to the traders who manage harvesting as well
                as marketing. </font></p>
