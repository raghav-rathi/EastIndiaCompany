        <h1>Almond Nut</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The scientific name or the botanical name of almond is “Prunus dulcis” which belongs to the family “Rosaceae” and the genus of almond is “Prunus”.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p> 
           Almonds are being grown, almost each and every corner of the world. However, growing an almond tree in suitable climate conditions and weather plays an important role in the fruit production. For the optimum growth rate, an almond tree plant requires moderate hot atmosphere having temp ranging between 28 °C to 38 °C and a cool winter for good filling of the kernel. Unopened blossoms of this crop are able to resist cold up to  – 2.0 °C, but petal fall stage blossoms can be easily get damaged by a temp. 0 °C and below temp.

This crop is able to resist temp. below – 2 °C for a short time period but if the conditions continue for a longer time, there are chances of crop damage and ower fruit production. This fruit crop can cultivated above 1,000 meter to 3,500 meter above m.s.l. However, they grow their best in the warm and dry climate condition with mild and wet winter. The ideal temp. for growing almond is 18 °C and 35 °C with about 500 chilling hours at the time of buds formation.

Note: Avoid plantation in very cold areas where frost conditions take place frequently since these fruit trees are very sensitive to the frost conditions.
