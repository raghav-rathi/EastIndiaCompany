                producer of sugar, topped only by Brazil. Nearly 2.8 lakh farmers have been cultivating
                sugarcane in the vast area of 4.4 lakh acres and over 11 crore people are directly or
                indirectly dependent on the sugar industry in the country. Sugarcane is one of the
                important commercial crops of India, grown in an area of 3.93 m.ha with annual production
                of 170 M.T. Sugarcane productivity in India is around 67 t/ha. It is one of the most
                important food-cum-cash crop grown in the country, providing employment to a larger number
                of people, in addition to earning considerable foreign exchange. </font></p></td>

                progressively fewer green leaves at the top. A ripe cane, out across with a sharp knife,
                shows against sunlight a slight sparkling in its flesh in contrast to the more watery cut
                surface of an unripe cane. If the grower can keep and use a hand sugar refractometer, the
                testing of maturity would be easier. The hand refractometer reading of 20, the cane crop
                may be considered to have reached the stage of maturity. Small Mill Test (SMT) will be a
                real solution for this perennial problem. For conducting SMT, few canes (say about 10
                canes) have to be cut from the field and the samples are analyzed after crushing the cane
                in a small mill for poll, brix, purity and ccs% in the laboratory which clearly gives the
                maturity status of the cane.</font></p></td>

                generally begins the sugarcane harvest about the first of November and continues for an
                average of 150 days. The sugarcane harvest is timed and coordinated undertaking to allow
                for maximum utilization of the mill's grinding capacity. At present the harvesting and
                supply of sugarcane is done by the farmers after receiving the cutting orders from the
                factory authorities. The cutting orders are issued depending upon the date of planting as
                found in the records and agreement between the farmers and factory. This system will not
                hold good, as uniform maturity of the cane crop cant be controlled even by planting
                early maturing varieties in the early season. In a typical harvesting unit, three or four
                harvesters operate in tandem with six to eight tractors and strings of wagons. The huge
                machines contain rotating knives, which cut the sugarcane at the base of the stalk. The
                cane tops are also cut off by rotating knives and the excess foliage is removed by giant
                extraction fans. As the sugarcane passes through the harvester, it is cut into 12-inch
                lengths called billets and then put into in-field wagons. The sugarcane is then hauled to
                near-by transfer stations and loaded into semi-trailers for delivery. </font></p></td>
