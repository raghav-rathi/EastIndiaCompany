            <h2>Organic ginger cultivation in Sikkim</h2>
            <p>Shri Nim Tshering Lepcha, the President of Lower Nandok of Nandok-Naitam GPU, East Sikkim district, is an innovative farmer engaging himself in different farm activities like off-season vegetable cultivation in low-cost houses, large cardamom cultivation, fishery, backyard poultry, dairy etc. to earn additional income. These ventures however, were not very much profitable with the amount of labour involvement. There was a lot of interest among the farmers, of the village to start the production of organic ginger in the region but the technological inputs and knowledge of cultivation was lacking. Shri Lepcha was in a dilemma in growing this crop for economic viability and in fact, he was having the problem in procurement of quality planting materials for further multiplication, proper processing and organized marketing.<br/><br/>
            <b>Technology/process intervened</b><br/>
            The scientists of ICAR-KVK, East Sikkim visited the village and the organic production of ginger technology was imparted through skill based trainings and demonstrations at farmersâ field. At first, he was provided with 200 kilograms of good quality ginger rhizomes (cv. Bhaisey) as seed material during the year 2013-14. Shri Lepcha successfully adopted the improved ginger cultivation technology under organic condition.
            <b>Effect of the technology /process </b><br/>
            The achievements of technological interventions of ginger cultivation with regard to the results from 2013-14 to 2017-18 is presented below:

            </table>
            <p><b>Impacts</b><br/>
            The crop is ready for harvest after 8.5-9 months of sowing with an average yield of 137.13 q/ha and average net return of Rs. 2,84,905/ha per year resulting B:C ratio  of the crop to the tune of 3.28.<br/><br/>
            Most of the farmers of Nandok village now are engaged in growing ginger which has become an important economic activity of the farmers of this area. The other fellow farmers in the village are motivated by the quality planting material based production technology of ginger under organic condition for its high return.  Among the growers, Mr. Phurba Lepcha of Upper Nandok is best known in the field of ginger production. He has wide practical knowledge and better experience in the field of ginger cultivation. It has also been reported that he has been able to produce 6500 kg of ginger crop out of 200 kg rhizome seed for two consecutive years. The ginger seeds so produced by Mr. Phurba Lepcha have a high demand in the local area for seed production. Thus, it became a necessary story in ginger cultivation, which encouraged other farmers of the region to opt for cultivation as high value cash crop ginger.<br/><br/>
            The technology demonstrated in an area of 0.10 ha in the field of Shri Nim Tshering Lepcha at Lower Nandok during 2013-14 has now extended to an area of 1.0 ha. Presently, more than 8 ha land is under ginger cultivation in Nandok village of East District.  The productive potential of the technology was tapped by majority of the maize growers and they have started ginger cultivation purely as sole crop, a suitable alternative to mandarin intercrop. This case study of ginger production technology has led to the adoption of this technology amongst many farmers, farm women and rural youth of Nandok and has also spread to nearby villages Thanzing, Upper Khamdong, Yangthang, Thanka and Lingtam villages of East Sikkim covering an area of 50 ha for sole crop of ginger.<br/><br/>
            The fresh ginger rhizomes are being sold to the traders/retailers and/or to the local merchants. Marketing agencies are managed by the private and government traders with the few co-operative societies that handle this product.<br/><br/>

            <h2>Ginger Cultivation: Ginger Harvesting and Post-Harvest Operations </h2>
            <p>In about eight to ten months depending upon the maturity of the variety, the ginger crop is ready to harvest. When fully mature leaves turn yellow and start drying up gradually.<br/>Harvesting is done from the 6th month onwards for making vegetable ginger.<br/><a href="Ginger-Post-Harvest-Operations.html">Read More</a></p>

            <h2><a name="1"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Ginger is an important spice and used in different forms such as raw ginger, dry
            ginger, bleached dry ginger, ginger powder oleoresin, ginger beer, ginger
            candy, ginger wine etc. Kerala is the major ginger growing state. Other
            major ginger growing states are Orissa, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh and
            Karnataka. Ginger grows in warm and humid climate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2>Requirement</h2>
            <b><a name="2"></a>Climate</b>
            <p>Ginger can be grown both under rainfed and irrigated conditions. A moderate rainfall at the sowing
            time till the rhizomes sprout, fairly heavy and well distributed showers
            during the growing period and dry weather for about a month before
            harvesting are necessary.</p>
            <b><a name="3"></a>Soil</b><br/>
            <p>Ginger thrives the best in well drained soils like sandy or clay loam, red loam, or lateritic
            loam. A friable loam rich in humus is ideal. It may not be desirable to
            grow ginger in the same site year after year.</p>
            <b><a name="4"></a>Preparation of land planting</b><br/>
            <p>The land is to be ploughed 4-5 times or dug thoroughly to bring the soil to fine tilth.
            Weeds, stubbles, roots etc removed. Beds of about one meter width, 15cm
            height and of any convenient length are prepared at an inter-space of 50cm
            in between beds. In case of irrigated crops, ridges are formed 40cm apart.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2><a name="5"></a>Varieties</h2>
            <p>They are generally named after the localities or places where they are grown. Common cultivars are
            Maran, Assam and Rio-de-Janeiro, Suprabha, Suruchi, Suravi, Himagiri,
            China, Himachal, Nadia, HSR-Varada.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2><a name="6"></a>Season</h2>
            <p>The best time for
            planting ginger in West Coast of India is during the first fortnight of
            May with the receipt of pre-monsoon showers. Under irrigated conditions,
            it can be planted well in advance during the middle of February or early
            March.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2><a name="7"></a>Propagation</h2>
            <p>Ginger is always propagated by rhizomes. Carefully preserved seeds rhizomes are cut into
            small pieces of 2.5-5cm length weighing 20-25g each having one or two good
            buds. The seed rate varies from region to region and with the method of
            cultivation adopted. The seed rhizomes are treated with 0.3% Dithane M-45
            (3g in one litre of water) for 30 min, drained and planted at a spacing of
            20-25cm along the rows and 20-25cm between the rows.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2><a name="8"></a>Manuring</h2>
            <p>At the time of planting, well decomposed and dried cattle manure or compost at the rate of 25-30
            tonnes per hectare is to be applied. It may be applied prior to planting
            or applied in planting pits at the time of planting. Application of neem
            cake at 2 tonnes per hectare at the time of planting helps in reducing the
            incidence of rhizome rot of ginger. In case of fertilizer 25bags per
            hectare 7:10:5 (bone meal) applied before planting. And 2-2.5 months after
            planting 5 bags per hectare of Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) should be
            applied by mixing in the soil and also 2.5 bags urea per hectare.</p>

            <h2>Intercultural operations</h2>
            <b><a name="9"></a>Mulching</b>
            <p>Mulching the ginger beds with green leaves is essential to enhance germination and to prevent
            washing off soil due to heavy rain.</p>
            <b><a name="10"></a>Weeding</b>
            <p>Weeding is done just before fertilizer application and mulching. Two or three weedings are
            required depending on the intensity of weed growth.</p>
            <b><a name="11"></a>Crop rotation and mixed cropping</b>
            <p>Ginger is commonly
            rotated with other crops. The crops most commonly rotated with ginger are
            tapioca, chillies, dry paddy in rainfed areas and ragi, groundnut, maize
            and vegetables, red gram and castor.</p>
