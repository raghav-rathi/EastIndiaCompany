            <h2><a name="1"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cardamom ( <i>Elettaria
                cardamomum L.)</i> popularly, known as Queen of Spices is native to the evergreen rainy
                forests of Western Ghats in South India. It is cultivated in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil
                Nadu. Cardamom is used for flavouring various preparations of food, confectionery,
                beverages and liquors.</p>

            <h2>Requirement</h2>
            <p><span><a name="2"></a><strong>Climate</strong></span><br/>It is grown in the areas
                where the annual rainfall ranges from 1500-4000mm, with a temperature range of 10-35<sup>o</sup>
                C and an altitude of 600-1200m above Mean Sea Level. Rainfall distribution should be good
                and summer showers during February-April are essential for panicle initiation.<br/><br/>
            <span><a name="3"></a><strong>Soil</strong></span><br/>Deep black loam soil
                with high humus content found in the forest region is best suited for cultivation. It also
                grows on laterite soils, clay loams and rich black soils having good drainage. Sandy soil
                is not suitable.<br/><br/>

            <h2><a name="5"></a>Nursery</h2>
            <p>Cardamom is propagated mainly through seeds and also through suckers each consisting of atleast one old and a
                young aerial shoot. Seedlings are normally raised in primary and secondary nurseries.
                Raised beds are prepared after digging the land to a depth of 30-45cm. The beds of 1m
                width and convenient length raised to a height of about 30cm are prepared. A fine layer of
                humus-rich forest soil is spread over the beds. Seed are to be collected from well ripe
                capsules. Immediately after harvesting, the husk is removed and the seeds are washed
                repeatedly in water for removing the mucilaginous coating. Seeds should be sown
                immediately after extraction. One kg of seed capsules may produce 5000 seedlings. Sowing
                may be taken up during November-January and is done in rows. Seed beds are to be dusted
                with chloropicrin or Carbon disulphide. The germination commences in about 30 days and may
                continue for a month or two. After germination, the mulch is to be removed.<br/><br/>
            <strong><a name="6"></a>Manuring</strong><br/>Manuring at the rate of
                90g nitrogen (N), 60g phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and 120g potash (K<sub>2</sub>O)
                per bed of 5x1m size, in three equal split doses at an interval of 45 days is recommended
                to produce healthier seedlings. The first dose of fertilizer may be applied 30 days after
                transplanting in the secondary nursery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2><a name="7"></a>Land preparation</h2>
            <p>Pits of 45x45x30cm size
                are dug in April-May and filled with a mixture of top soil and compost or well decomposed
                farm yard manure. In slopy land, contour terraces may be made and pits may be taken along
                the contour and a close planting (2mx1m) is advisable along the contour.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2><a name="8"></a>Planting</h2>
            <p>The planting is carried
                out during the rainy season commencing from June. Seedlings are to be planted upto the
                collar region for better growth. Cloudy days with light drizzle are ideal for planting.
                Generally in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the seedlings are transplanted in March-May at a
                spacing of 20x 20 cm and mulched immediately. Beds are to be covered with an over head
                pandal and should be watered regularly.</p>

            <h2><a name="9"></a>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>A fertilizer does of
                75kg nitrogen (N), 75kg phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and 150g potash (K<sub>2</sub>O)
                per ha is recommended under irrigated condition for high yielding plantation yielding 100
                kg/ha and above and a dose of 30:60:30 kg/ha is recommended for gardens under rainfed
                condition. Organic manures like compost or cattle manure may be given @5 kg per clump.
                Fertilizer is applied in two split doses. The first application during May will help in
                the production of suckers and development of capsules and the second application during
                late September will help the initiation of panicles and sucker. Only half the dose of
                fertilizer is to be applied during the first year and full dose is given from second year
                onwards. Application of fertilizer is done at a radius of 30cm and covered with a thin
                layer of soil.</p>

            <h2><a name="10"></a>Irrigation</h2>
            <p>In order to overcome the dry spell during summer, it is necessary to irrigate the crop to get maximum production as
                it helps in initiation of panicles, flowering and fruit set. They may be irrigated at an
                interval of 10-15days till the onset of monsoon.</p>

            <h2>Intercultural operations</h2>
            <p><span><a name="11"></a><strong>Mulching</strong></span><br/>It is an important
                cultural practice in cardamom. Fallen leaves of the shade trees are utilized for mulching.
                Sufficient mulch should be applied during November-December to reduce the ill effects of
                drought, which prevails for nearly 4-5 months during summer. Exposing the panicle over
                mulch is beneficial for pollination.<br/><br/>
            <span><a name="12"></a><strong>Weeding</strong></span><br/>
                The first round of
                weeding is to be carried in May-June, the second in August-September and the third in
                December-January. Weedicides like paraquat @625ml in 500 litres of water may be sprayed in
                the interspaces between rows leaving 60cm around the plant base.<br/><br/>
            <span><a name="13"></a><strong>Trashing</strong></span><br/>
                Trashing consists of removing old and drying shoots of the plant once in a year with the onset of monsoon under
                rainfed conditions and 2-3 times in high density plantations provided with irrigated
                facilities.<br/><br/>
            <span><a name="14"></a><strong>Shade regulation</strong></span><br/>
                It is very sensitive to moisture stress. Shade helps to regulate soil moisture as well as temperature and provides
                congenial micro-climate for cardamom. Excess shade is also quite detrimental and shade has
                to be regulated so as to provide 50-60% filtered sunlight. In order to provide adequate
                light during monsoon, shade regulation may be taken up before the onset of monsoon.<br/><br/>
            <span><a name="15"></a><strong>Earthing up</strong></span><br/>
                After the monsoon is over, a thin layer of fresh fertile soil, rich in organic matter may be earthed up at the
                base of the clump, covering up to the collar region be scraping between the rows or
                collecting soil from staggered trenches/check pits. This encourages new growth.<br/><br/>

            <h2><a name="30"></a>Harvesting and processing</h2>
            <p>Cardamom plants normally
                start bearing two years after planting. In most of the areas the peak period of harvest is
                during October-November. Picking is carried out at an interval of 15-25 days. Ripe
                capsules are harvested in order to get maximum green colour during curing. After harvest,
                capsules are dried either in fuel kiln or electrical drier or in the sun. It has been
                found that soaking the freshly harvested green cardamom capsules in 2% washing soda
                solution for 10 minutes prior to drying helps to retain the green colour during drying.
                When drier is used, it should be dried at 45-50<sup>o</sup> C for 14-18 hours, while for
                kiln, over night drying at 50-60<sup> o</sup> C is required. The capsules kept for drying
                are spread thinly and stirred frequently to ensure uniform drying. The dried capsules are
                rubbed with hands or coir mat or wire mesh and winnowed to remove any foreign matter. They
                are then sorted out according to size and colour, and stored in black polythene lined
                gunny bags to retain the green colour during storage. </p>
