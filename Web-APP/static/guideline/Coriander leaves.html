            <p>Coriander <i>(Coriandrum
                sativum L.)</i> is an annual herb, mainly cultivated for its fruits as well as for the
                tender green leaves. It is native of the Mediterranean region. In India, it is grown in
                Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Major portion is
                though consumed locally; a small quantity is being exported now. </p>

            <tr><td colspan="2" style="border:0; padding-top:0px;"><p>The fruits have a
                fragrant odour and pleasant aromatic taste. The odour and taste are due to the essential
                oil content, which varies from 0.1 to 1.0 % in the dry seeds. These essential oils are
                used for flavouring liquors, coca preparations in confectionary and also to mask the
                offensive odours in pharmaceutical preparations.</p></td></tr>
            <tr><td style="border:0; padding-top:0px;"><p>The dried ground fruits are the major
                ingredients of the curry powder. The whole fruits are also used to flavour foods like
                pickles, sauces and confectionary. The young plants as well as the leaves are used in the
                preparation of chutney and are also used as seasonings in curries, soups, sauces and
                chutneys. It has medicinal properties too. Fruits are said to have carminative, diuretic,
                tonic, stomachic and aphrodisiac properties. </p></td>

            <h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
            <p>It is a tropical crop
                and can be grown throughout the year (except very hot season i.e. March-May) for leaf
                purpose, but for higher grain yield it has to be grown in specific season. A dry and cold
                weather free from frost especially during flowering and fruit setting stage favours good
                grain production. Cloudy weather during flowering and fruiting stage favours pest and
                disease incidences. Heavy rain affects the crop. As an irrigated crop, it can be
                cultivated on almost all types of soils provided sufficient organic matter is applied.
                Black cotton soils with high retentivity of moisture is best under rainfed conditions. </p>

            <h2>Varieties</h2>
            <p>Many improved varieties of coriander are now available for cultivation in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh,
                Gujarat and Rajasthan states.</p>

            <h2>Land preparation</h2>
            <p>For raising a rainfed crop, the land is ploughed 3 to 4 times following rains and field must be planted
                immediately to break the clods and to avoid soil moisture. For irrigated crop the land is
                ploughed twice or thrice and beds and channels are formed. </p>

            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2>Sowing</h2>
            <p>In the North and Central parts of India and Andhra Pradesh, it is mostly grown as a Rabi season crop and
                hence sowing is done between middle of October and middle of November. In certain pockets
                of the above area, late kharif crop is sometimes sown in August-September. In Tamil Nadu,
                as an irrigated crop, coriander is raised in June-July and September-October. In the first
                season, the crop matures late with an extended growth phase during January-February. The
                growth and the yield rainfed conditions, it is sown during September-October, at the onset
                of Northeast monsoon and harvested during January-February.<br/><br/>A seed rate of 10 to
                15 kg per hectare is required. Seeds stored for 15 to 30 days record better and early
                germination than freshly harvested seeds. Seeds soaked in water for 12 to 24 hours before
                sowing also enhances better germination. The seeds are split into two halves by rubbing
                and generally done in rows spaced at 30 to 40 cm apart with 15 cm between hills. Soil
                depth should not exceed 3.0 cm. Three to five seeds are sown in seeds are broadcast and
                covered with country plough. Germination takes place in 10 to 15 days. </p>

            <h2>Manures and fertilisers</h2>

            <h2>Harvesting and yield</h2>
            <p>The crop will be ready for harvest in about 90 to 110 days depending upon the varieties and growing season.
                Harvesting has to be done when the fruits are fully ripe and start changing from green to
                brown colour. Delaying of the harvest should be avoided lest shattering during harvest and
                splitting of the fruits in subsequent processing operations. The plants are cut or pulled
                and poled into small stacks in the field to beating with sticks or rubbing with hands. The
                produce is winnowed, cleaned and dried in partial shade. After drying, the produce is
                stored in gunny bags lined with paper. The rainfed crop yields on an average 400 to 500
                kg/ha and the irrigated crop 600 to 1200kg/ha.</p>

            <h2>Plant protection</h2>
            <p>At the seedling stage coriander is often attacked by the leaf eating caterpillars and semi-loopers and at the
                flowering stage by the aphids. Spraying the crop with methyl demeton (0.05%) is
                recommended to control the aphids but a flowering stage the use of any insecticide would
                kill the bee population affecting pollination in the crop.<br/><br/>Powdery mildew (<i>Erysiphe
                polygoni</i>) is a serious disease, which ruin the crop if allowed unchecked in the
                initial stage itself. Spraying wettable sulphur 0.25% or 0.2% solution of Karathane twice
                at 10 to 15 days interval is recommended. Grain mould is caused by <i>Helminthosporium</i>
                sp., <i>Alternaria</i> sp., <i>Carvularia</i> sp. and <i>Fusarium</i> sp. It can be
                controlled by spraying carbendazim 0.1% 20 days after grain set.</p>
