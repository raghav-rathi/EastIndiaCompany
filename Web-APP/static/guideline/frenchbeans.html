        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p> 
            In the hilly region it is grown during kharif and in lower hills/tarai region, sown as spring crop. In north-east plains and hilly tracts of Maharashtra, it is cultivated during rabi. It is highly sensitive to frost and water logging. The ideal temperature range for proper growth of this crop is 10 - 270 C. Above 300 C, the flower drop is a serious problem. Similarly, below 50 C the flowers and developing pods and branches are damaged.
