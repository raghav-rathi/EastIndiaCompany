        <h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction: </h2>
        <p>Sorghum (<i>Sorghum vulgare</i> Pers.), popularly known as <i>jowar</i>,
                is the most important food and fodder crop of dryland agriculture. The annual area under
                it ranges between 17 and 18 million hectares and the annual production between 8 and 10
                million tonnes. <br /><br />Sorghum is originated in India and Africa. It is also said that its
                origin is Abyssinia and from there it was brought to USA and European countries.<br /><br />Jowar<i> </i>is mainly concentrated in the peninsular and central India. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (the Bundelkhand region) and Tamil Nadu are the major jowar &#150; growing states.
                Other states grow sorghum in small areas primarily for fodder. <br /><br />The sorghum
                grain is used primarily as human food in various forms, such as <i>roti</i> or <i>bhakri </i>(unleavened
                bread), or is cooked like rice. Sorghums are also malted, popped and several local
                preparations are made. Green and dried fodder is the most important roughage for feeding
                cattle throughout the country. The utilization of grain sorghum as a cattle feed, poultry
                ration and other industrial uses is at present not very significant, although considerable
                scope exists.</p>

        <h2><a name="cli"></a>Climate and soil:</h2>
        <p>Sorghum plants are very hardy and can withstand high temperature and drought, however, it is grown in arid regions of U.P, Rajasthan and humid regions of Bengal and Bihar. It may be successfully grown under atmospheric temperature ranging between 15 <sup>0</sup>C to 40 <sup>0</sup>C and annual rainfall ranging from 400 to 1000 mm.<br /><br />Sorghum is grown on a variety of soil types but the clayey loam soil rich in humus is found to be the most ideal soil. It may tolerate mild acidity to mild salinity under pH 5.5 to 8.0. A good sorghum soil must have an efficient drainage facilities though, it may withstand water logging more than maize.</p>

        <h2><a name="land"></a>Land Preparation: </h2>
        <p>Deep summer ploughing with mould board plough soon after rabi crop is
                harvested and leaving the soil exposed to sun until onset of monsoon is a common practice.
                With the onset of monsoon the land should be ploughed twice by country plough. But the
                soil for grain crop should be pulverised for a fine tilth by harrowing and cross
                plankings. If desired, field should be levelled before sowing so that rainwater may be
                well distributed throughout the field.</p>

        <h2><a name="sow"></a>Sowing:</h2>
        <p><b>a) Sowing time:</b>Sorghum crop is grown in almost all the seasons of the year. In
                Northern India conditions it is grown in kharif season but in Southern India the crop is
                grown during Rabi and summer seasons. Kharif crop should be sown soon after first break of
                monsoon rains i.e. nearly in last week of June. Therefore, the best sowing time is in last
                week of June to first week of July depending upon onset of monsoon. Whereas rabi jawar is
                sown in the month of October to November.<br /><br />
                <b>b) Spacing:</b>A spacing of 40-45 cm between the rows and 15-20 cm between the
                plants is quite satisfactory.<br /><br />
                <b>c) Seed rate: </b>
                Required plant population may be obtained by using a seed rate of 8-12
                kg/ha. The seeds are sown about 3-4 cm deep in the furrows.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row space-clear">
        <h2><a name="seed"></a>Seed treatment:</h2>
        <p>The seed treatment may be done by Agrosan GN, Thiram at the
                rate of 3g/kg of seed or sulphur at the rate of 5g/kg of seed. The seed is treated, dried
                and sown in the field.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row space-clear">
        <h2><a name="app"></a>Application of mannurs and fertilizers:</h2>
        <p>Sorghum is an exhaustive crop and it depletes soil fertility
                very fast, if proper care is not taken. The fertilizer doses differ from type to type and
                nature of crop to be grown e.g. local varieties need less quantity than hybrid ones.
                Similarly, irrigated crop requires higher doses than rainfed ones no matter whether it is
                a local or high yielding variety. Considering all these points an optimum dose may be
                found out from the following details: an optimum dose of nitrogen for rainfed high
                yielding and local varieties of irrigated crop should be 60-80kg/ha while for irrigated
                high yielding varieties it should be between 120-150 kg/ha. In case of heavy soils one
                single application gives better results than split application but in case of light soils
                split application i.e. half basal and remaining half as top-dressing at knee-height stage
                or 30-35 days after sowing is preferred. Under low rainfall or in rainfed areas
                top-dressing of nitrogen is not required. On an average a dose of 40-60 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/ha
                is found to be good. Placement at 4-6 cm depth has given better results. However, under
                normal conditions it is mostly basal placed. Potash at the rate of 40kg/ha applied at the
                time of field preparation gives good result.</p>

        <div class="row space-clear">
        <h2><a name="inter"></a>Interculture :</h2>
        <p>Manual weedings and hoeings help in solving the weed problem
                but it is possible only during rabi and arid cropping seasons while rains do not permit
                the manual weeding or hoeing during kharif season. Application of herbicides like atrazine
                @ 0.5 kg a.i./ha or Propazine @1.0 kg a.i./ha dissolved in 900-1000 liters of water,
                therefore, becomes obviously essential to control weeds. These herbicides should be
                applied before emergence of sorghum seedlings.</p>

        <div class="row space-clear">
        <h2><a name="irri"></a>Irrigation:</h2>
        <p>Sorghum is a fairly drought resistant crop and it does very
                well in areas receiving 50 cm well distributed rainfall but it cannot withstand
                waterlogging at any stage of crop growth. The most critical growth stages for irrigation
                are knee-height stage, flowering and grain filling stages at which the crop should be
                ensured for proper moisture conditions so that the crop does not suffer from moisture
                stress.Contrary to this in kharif crop an efficient drainage must be provided as the crop
                cannot tolerate water accumulation for more than few hours, therefore, in low lying areas
                sowing of crop on 5-7cm high ridges or sowing in flat beds followed by light earthing is a
                remedy for stagnant water in the field.</p>

        <p><b>a) Harvesting</b><br>The high yielding varieties mature in about 100-120 days duration
                after which they are harvested. Generally two methods of harvesting i.e. either stalk-cut
                or cutting of earheads by sickles are employed. However, in foreign countries sorghum
                harvesters are used. In case of stock cut method the plants are cut from near the ground
                level, the stalks are tied into bundles of convenient removed from plants, while in later
                case the earheads, after their removal from the standing crop, are piled up on the
                threshing floor and after few days they are threshed. Threshing of earheds is done either
                by beating them with sticks or by trampling them under bullock&#146;s feet. Later method
                is quicker and is practiced by majority of farmers who use to grow the crop on larger
                scale.<br><br>
                <b>b) Yield</b><br>The grain yield of improved varieties under assured water supply
                ranges between 25-35 quintals/ha and that of hay or karvi between 150-170 quintals/ha.<br><br>
