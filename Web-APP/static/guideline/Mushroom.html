                (Lange) Sing is popularly known as the button mushroom. This mushroom is extensively
                cultivated throughout the world and contributes about 40% of the total world production of
                mushroom. At present, India is roughly producing about 20,000 tonnes of this mushroom. The
                reasons for such a low production can be attributed to lack of awareness among masses,
                shortage of quality spawn, use of traditional methods of cultivation and inadequacy of
                post harvest disposal facilities. In India, the potential for the cultivation of this
                mushroom is tremendous due to vast availability of agricultural wastes. According to a
                rough estimate, about 300 million tonnes of straw is produced in India annually and if
                only 0.5% of it is utilized for white button mushroom production, then about 3,00,000
                tonnes of mushroom can be produced which would be the highest production of mushroom any
                country in the world.</font></p></td>

                using conventional methods. Usually, unpasteurized compost is used, hence yields are very
                low. However, in recent years, yield of mushroom has increased as a result of introduction
                of improved agronomic practices. Cultivation of the common white button mushroom requires
                technical skill. Apart from other factors, the system requires humidity, two different

                products like cereal straw (wheat, barley, paddy, oat and rice), maize stalks, hay,
                sugarcane bagasse or any other cellulose wastes can be employed. Wheat straw should be
                freshly harvested, shining yellow in colour and should not have been exposed to rains. The
                straw should be in about 5-8cm long pieces, otherwise heap prepared by long straw would be
                less compact which may lead to improper fermentation. Conversely; too short straw makes
                heap too compact to allow enough oxygen to enter the centre of the heap and lead to
                anaerobic fermentation. Wheat straw or any of the above materials provide cellulose,
                hemicellulose and lignin, which are utilized by the mushroom mycelium as the carbon
                source. These materials also provide physical structure to the substrate needed to ensure
                proper aeration during composting for the build up of microflora, which is essential for
                the fermentation. Rice and barley straw are very soft, degrade very quickly during
                composting and also absorb more water as compared to wheat straw. While using these
                substrates, care should, therefore, be taken on the quantity of water to be used, schedule
                of turnings and adjustment to the rate and type of supplements. Since the byproducts used
                in composting do not have adequate nitrogen and other components required for the
                fermentation process, compounding mixture is supplemented with the nitrogen and
                carbohydrates, to start this process.</font></p></td>
