        <h1>Pigeon pea</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
           Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth) is one of the most common tropical and subtropical legumes cultivated for its edible seeds. Pigeon pea is fast growing, hardy, widely adaptable, and drought resistant (Bekele-Tessema, 2007). Because of its drought resistance it can be considered of the utmost importance for food security in regions where rainfall is unreliable and droughts are prone to occur (Crop Trust, 2014).

          Pigeon pea can be grown for seed production, or forage production, or both. Some dual purpose cultivars have been developed. Pigeon pea cultivated for food can be sown alone or intercropped with cereal crops (maize, millet), oilcrops (cotton, groundnut, sesame) or grain legumes (cowpea) (Bekele-Tessema, 2007; Cook et al., 2005; Duke, 1983). Seeds should be sown (drilled, broadcast or hand dibbled) in a weeded, deep and well prepared seedbed at 2.5 cm to 10 cm depth (Valenzuela, 2011; AFF, 2009; Duke, 1983). Sowing as a sole crop should be done on a 2 m grid (Cook et al., 2005). Pigeon pea does not establish easily. It may require irrigation during the first 2 months if rainfall is insufficient. It is important to ensure effective weed control (Valenzuela, 2011; AFF, 2009; Duke, 1983). In association with maize, it has been recommended that pigeon pea density remains about 2 plants/mÂ² so that competition for water is not detrimental to the maize (CIMMYT, 2011). Pigeon pea has a very variable growing pattern. Depending on the cultivar, the location and time of sowing, flowering can occur as early as 100 days or as late as 430 days. In the West Indies, the range was within 60-237 days between planting and pod formation, time for flowering being only 60 days. In India, pigeon pea can take 8 months between sowing and flowering (Duke, 1983).
