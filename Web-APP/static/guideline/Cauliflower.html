        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p>
                Cauliflower grows generally during cold season, and requires optimum temperature conditions to produce the edible bud of the cauliflower. Cauliflower is now able to adjust to diverse range of climatic condition, mostly in temperate tropics and tropical parts. Since it is a cold season vegetable, optimum temperature for its growth ranges between 18 to 20°C, something required from vegetative to curding phase transition. The tropical variety although is able to grow even at 35°C. In temperate region, if the temperature is about 0°C, the young seedling growth may stop. If it is subjected to very high or low temperature, it tends to form small curds and also causes yellowing and raciness of the curd
