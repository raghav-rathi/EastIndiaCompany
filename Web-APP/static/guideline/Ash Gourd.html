        <h1>Ash Gourd</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Ash Gourd derives its name due to the colour of the skin of the fruit which is Ash, In some regions the skin of the Ash Gourd is having a waxy shine and hence it is called, Wax Gourd. The Ash Gourd can be cultivated even during rainy seasons and hence the name, Winter Gourd.
            It originated from South Asia including India, where mention of the fruit finds place in Ayurvedic preparations for the medicinal properties and it is mentioned by the name of ‘Kushmanda’ in Sanskrit. It is widely grown throughout South and South East Asia, including Myanmar, Malaysia, China, Japan and almost all countries of South East Asia as a prominent crop. It does not grow in Western Countries, since it cannot survive the extreme cold.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p> 
            Fruits are harvested after three months of sowing. Harvesting can be done at weekly intervals. Harvesting of fruits can be done at immature stage and at mature stage. It is advisable to harvest fruits at immature stage for food consumption. If fruits are harvested at immature stage at frequent intervals application of Fertilisers in splits as top dressing is advised. Mature fruits are harvested for long distance transport requirements which takes time an for seed extraction. The matured fruits will have developed with full waxy coating on the surface. We can get more tonnage if we harvest fruits at immature stage than after maturity, since keeping fruits in the plant for long time will hinder further fruit formation. For seed purpose the fruits are left unharvested till all the veins and stalks are fully dried.
