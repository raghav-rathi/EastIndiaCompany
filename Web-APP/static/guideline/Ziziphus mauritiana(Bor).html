        <h1>Ziziphus mauritiana(Bor)</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
                Indian jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana Lam.) is a shrub or small tree of the dry tropical and subtropical regions that is browsed by livestock.
                Indian jujube is a multi-purpose tree mainly grown for its fruits. It starts bearing fruits 6-8 years after planting, and yield increases until the tree is 15-20 years old (Ecocrop, 2013). The fruit is edible and can be eaten fresh, dried like dates, candyied, salted or pickled (Ecocrop, 2013; Latiff, 1991). It can be processed into flour meal, paste, juice, syrup or an alcoholic beverage (Latiff, 1991). It is a good source of carotene, vitamins A and C, and fatty oils (Orwa et al., 2009). Young leaves are edible and are cooked as a vegetable in Indonesia. Fruits and bark are used to make dye and medicinal preparations (Ecocrop, 2013; Orwa et al., 2009). Indian jujube wood is reddish, fine-textured, hard and durable. It can be used in rural house construction, posts and tool manufacturing. It makes excellent firewood. The Indian jujube tree hosts lac insects, and is also fodder for the tasar silkworm that makes high-prized silk in India (Orwa et al., 2009). It is a minor source of pollen for bees (Orwa et al., 2009). A potential agroforestry species, this thorny tree can grown to provide windbreaks and living fences. It is browsed by livestock and its leaves are nutritious fodder for sheep and goats (Ecocrop, 2013; Orwa et al., 2009; Nair, 1993).

        <h3>Climate and Cultivation</h3>
        <p>
                Plants of the Ziziphus genus can withstand extreme stress caused by drought, salinity, and in some cases waterlogging. Cultivated jujubes are thus ideal for planting in sites unfit for other crops, such as marginal or degraded areas, provided that the right genotypes are selected for alkali or sodic soils (Hebbara et al., 2002; Dagar et al., 2001). Indian jujube can be used for coastal dune sand fixation (Orwa et al., 2009; Azam-Ali et al., 2006). Indian jujube grafted on Ziziphus nummularia can be grown on saline soils (Ecocrop, 2013). In the Sahelian climate, Indian jujube provides permanent cover to the soil, with the abundant and deep root system helping to maintain soil structure (Arndt et al., 2001; Depommier, 1988).
