                <h2><a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction:</b></h2>
                <p>Wheat (<i>Triticum spp</i>.) occupies the prime position among the food crops in the world. In
                    India, it is the second important food crop being next to rice and contributes to the
                    total foodgrain production of the country to the extent of about 25%. Wheat has played a
                    very vital role in stabilizing the foodgrain production in the country over the past few
                    years.<br/><br/>The origin of the durum wheats was probably in the region of Abyssinia,
                    whereas the whole group of soft wheat, which includes the bread wheats, probably
                    originated in the region of Pakistan, SouthWestern and the Southern parts of mountainous
                    Bokhara.<br/><br/>
                <b>Classification of Indian Wheats:</b><br/>
                <strong>1. Emmer Wheat (Triticum dicoccum schub L.) :</strong><br/> This type was reported to be grown in south i.e. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. This type is believed to be developed from T. diccoides koru., a wild form. It is also grown in Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia.<br/><br/>
                <strong>2. Macroni Wheat ( T.durum Desf.) :</strong> The durum or macroni wheat, cultivation in India, is considered to be very old. It is a best wheat for drought conditions or under restricted irrigated conditions of Punjab, M.P., Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, West Bengal and H.P. It is used for semolina (suji) preparation.<br/><br/>
                <strong> 3. Common Bread Wheat ( T. vulgare Host) :</strong><br/>
                        It is a typical wheat of alluvial soils of Indo-Gangetic plains i.e.Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,
                        Bihar and parts of Rajasthan. The bulk of the Indian crop, therefore, consists of this type.<br/><br/>
                <strong>4. Indian Dwarf Wheat (T.spherococcum Mihi.) :</strong><br/>
                        This belongs to the club wheat of western countries. This is found in limited areas of
                        M.P., U.P., of India and in Pakistan. These are characterised by very short and compact
                        heads having a shorter grains.<br/><br/>
                <strong>5. Triticum aestivum :</strong><br/>
                        This is the type presently grown in India in almost all the wheat growing zones. It is used mainly for bread purpose.</p>

                <h2><a name="cli"></a>Climate and Soil:</h2>
                <p>The ideal temperature requirement varies from plant type and stages of growth. The dwarf
                    varieties require the following temperature for their growth and development:<br/></p>
                <table class="table table-bordered" style="width:75% ;font-size:14px">
                <tr><th>Growth stages</th><th>Temperature requirement</th></tr>

                <tr><td>Proper grain filling</td><td>23 to 25 0 C mean daily temperature.</td></tr>
                </table>
                <p>Wheat plants are sensitive to very cold or frost injury at any stage of growth particularly at reproductive growth if temperature is below 150</p>
                </div>
                <div class="space-clear" style="margin-top:10px;">
                <h2><a name="land"></a>Land Preparation:</h2>
                <p>The wheat crop requires a well-pulverized but compact seed bed for good and uniform
                    germination. Three or four ploughings in the summer, repeated harrowing in the rainy
                    season, followed by three or four cultivations and planking immediately before sowing
                    produce a good, firm seed bed for the dry crop on alluvial soils. For the irrigated crop,
                    the land is given a pre-sowing irrigation (palewa or raund) and the number of ploughings
                    is reduced. Where white ants or other pests are a problem, Aldrin 5% or BHC 10% dust at
                    the rate of 25 kg/ha should be applied to the soil after the last ploughing or before
                    planking.<br/></p>

                <h2><a name="sow"></a>Sowing:</h2>
                <p><b>a) Sowing time:</b><br/> Based on above temperature requirement it has been found that for
                    indigenous wheat last week of October, for long duration dwarf varieties like Kalyansona,
                    Arjun, etc. first fortnight of November and for short duration dwarf wheats like Sonalika,
                    Raj 821 etc. second fortnight is the best sowing time. Under exceptionally late sown
                    condition it may be delayed to latest by 1<sup>st</sup> week of December beyond which if
                    area is very small transplanting may be practiced.<br/><br/>
                <b>b) Seed rate:</b><br/>
                    Generally, a seed rate of 100 kg/ha has been found to be sufficient
                    for most of the varieties like Kalyan Sona, Arjun, Janak, etc.which have moderate
                    tillering and medium sized grains. But a higher seed rate of 125 kg/ha is desirable for
                    late sown wheat and normal sown for varieties like Sonalika, Raj 821 etc. which have bold
                    grains and shy tillering habits.<br/><br/>
                <b>c) Spacing: : </b><br/>For irrigated, timely sown wheat, a row spacing of 15 to 22.5 cm is
                    followed, but 22.5 cm between the rows is considered to be the optimum spacing. Under
                    irrigated late-sown conditions, a row spacing of 15-18 cm is the optimum. For dwarf
                    wheats, the planting depth should be between 5 and 6 cm. Planting beyond this depth
                    results in a poor stand. In the case of conventional tall varieties, the depth of sowing
                    may be 8 or 9 cm.<br/><br/>
                <b>d) Seed treatment:</b><br/>The seed of loose smut-susceptible varieties should be given solar
                    or hot-water treatment. If the wheat seed is used only for sowing, and not for human
                    consumption or for feeding cattle, it can be treated with Vitavax.<br/></p>

                <h2><a name="app"></a>Application of Mannures and Fertilizer</h2>
                <p>It is desirable that 2 to 3 tonnes of farmyard manure per hectare or some other organic
                    matter is applied 5 or 6 weeks before sowing. The fertilizer requirement of the irrigated
                    wheat crop are as follows:<br/>
                </p><ol type="a">
                <li>With assured fertilizer supply:</li>
                <p>Nitrogen (N) @8- - 120 kg/ha <br/>
                      Phosphorus (P2O5) @ 40- 60 kg/ha<br/>
                      Potash (K2O) @ 40 kg/ha. </p>
                <li>Under fertilizer constraints: <br/>
                        N @ 60-80 kg/ha<br/>
                        P2O5 @ 30-40 kg/ha<br/>
                        K2O @ 20-25 kg/ha.</li>
                </ol><br/><br/>Total quantity of Phosphorus and potash and half the quantity of
                    nitrogen should be applied at the time of sowing. Remaining quantity of Nitrogen should be
                    applied at the time of crown root initiation.For the late sown irrigated wheat crop, the
                    NPK fertilizer dose recommended is: <br/>N  60-80 kg/ha<br/>
                    P2O5  30-40 kg/ha<br/>
                    K2O  20-25 kg/ha.<br/>

                    which come at 21-25 days after sowing (DAS), 45-60 DAS, 60-70 DAS, 90-95 DAS, 100-105 DAS
                    and 120-125 DAS respectively. Off these irrigation at CRI stage is most important. <br/></p>

                <p><b>a) Harvesting:</b><br/> The rain-fed crop reaches the harvest stage much earlier than the
                    irrigated crop. The crop is harvested when the grains become hard and the straw becomes
                    dry and brittle.The harvesting is mostly done by sickle. The crop is threshed by treading
                    with cattle on the threshing-flour or by power driven thresher.<br/><br/>
                <b>b) Yield: </b><br/>The national average yield of wheat grain is about 12 to 13.8 quintals
                    per hectare.<br/><br/>
                <b>c) Storage: </b><br/>The grains should be thoroughly dried before storage. The storage life
                    of the grain is closely related to its moisture content. Grains with less than 10 percent
                    moisture store well. The storage pits, bins or godowns should be moisture-proof and should
                    be fumigated to keep down the stored  grain pests including rats. Zinc phosphide is
                    very effective against rats.<br/></p>
