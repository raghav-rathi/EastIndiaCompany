        <h1>Coriander</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
           No African cuisine is complete without the usage of Dhania. The aroma of the leaves and the seeds is simply irresistible.  Coriander grows with almost zero maintenance. From seed to plant, the coriander grows very vigorously and is ready to harvest in a span of a month and half to experience your return on investments but for seeds, you will need 3 to 4 months.. Locally, the demand for coriander just like other vegetables such as the kale, carrots, tomatoes and spinach is also growing.     
        </p>
        
        <p>
           Coriander plants are very small and do not grow more than two inches or so. Once the leaves appear fully grown, you might want to pluck them and use. But if you wish to harvest coriander seeds, leave the plants to bloom. Within a weekâ€™s span, tiny yellow flowers blossom and soon you will also see dhania seeds popping out.
        </p>
      
        <p> 
           Home grown coriander develops very quickly and is harvested immediately. This leaves with no space for pest infestation. However, too much dampness of the soil can give rise to rot which spreads very fast all over the crop. After the flowers blossom and seeds set in, there are chances of aphid infestation. Aphids eat up the seeds and cause large scale destruction. Timely usage of an organic pesticide will help.
