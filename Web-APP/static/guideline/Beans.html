            <h1>Beans</h1>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The beans belong to the family Leguminosae. They are considered as nutritious vegetables as they contain high
                amount of vegetable proteins. Besides carbohydrates and vitamins. The green tender pods
                are used as vegetable and also the dry seeds. The beans for drying are grown till the
                seeds are large enough and pod begins to dry. The pods are shelled and seeds are
                separated. The shelled dry bean has good market.<br/><br/>The various beans
                cultivated in India particularly in home gardens and some commercially are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>French beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)</li>
            <li>Cow pea (Vigna sinensis)</li>
            <li>Cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba)</li>
            <li>Broad bean (Vicia faba)</li>
            <li>Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus)</li>
            <li>Soya bean (Glucine max)</li>
            <li>Garden beans (Dolichos lab lab).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There are also many other beans, which are grown in south and northeastern India and in the hilly regions.</p>

            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h1>French beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)</h1>
            <p>The French beans which
                are also called as snap bean has dwarf type and pole type. Generally it needs cool climate
                and therefore cultivated during Rabi season, cut as the bean is day-neutral plant. It can
                be cultivated in August  September and also from December - February in northern
                India. The pole type is a climbing plant and needs some support to climb, either bamboo or
                wooden sticks. The dwarf type is bushy and needs no support. The beans are planted in rows
                by hand or by a seed drill. In Rabi sowing if the temperature is low or cold germination
                may not be satisfactory. Bean should be harvested during tender stage or otherwise they
                develop strings. For dry beans it should be allowed to mature fully. The beans can be
                grown in a wide range of soil types but sandy loam is best.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h1>Cow pea (Vigna sinensis)</h1>
            <p>The cowpea is a warm
                season bean and grown during rainy season but the temperature should not be below 200C. It
                is trailing plant and needs staking. The early varieties require 70 to 90 days to mature
                while the late varieties need 120 to 150 days. Well-drained loamy soil is best but can be
                grown in any type of soil. There are many cowpea varieties, some are bushy and dwarf and
                some creeping. The seeds also differ in colour, size, shape and pods. Many excellent
                improved high yielding varieties have been evolved by I.A.R.I. New Delhi. Similarly,
                improved varieties have been evolved in Coimbatore, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra
                etc. The early varieties can be harvested within 60 days while the late varieties in 90 to
                100 days. To use as vegetable it should be harvested early otherwise soon they become
                leathery and stringy. Usually the pods are best for edible in tender stage. The dried
                seeds are used as pulse. The varieties, manure and fertilizer requirements, spacing etc.
                are mentioned in specific chapters. </p>

                grown throughout India. There are many local types particularly in eastern India and in
                south. It needs cool climate but can be grown in any kind of soils. The colour of flowers,

                bean for kitchen garden. The tender pods are used as vegetable. Some plants are bushy and
                semi-erect while others are climbing. The flowers may be white, pink, purple and light
                violet and borne as axillary racemes. The pods may be flat or bulged with different shapes
                and colour. Some are improved by I.A.R.I. and at Coimbatore and Kalianpur. The seeds are
                sown in pits during June  July and climbing type needs overhead trellis or bower to
                trail. Tender pods are used as vegetable.</p>

            <div class="row space-clear">
            <h1>Cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba)</h1>
            <p>The cluster bean is
                mainly grown in the dry, warm, arid regions of India, which is known as Guar. The plant is
                hardy annual 1 to 3 meters in height. There are dwarf and tall types. The seeds are black,
                brown and white. The fleshy green tender pods are used as vegetables. The rough skinned
                hairy types are used as fodder for the cattle and also as green manuring crop. The crushed
                seeds are turned into flour known as guar gum, which is used in various industries like
                paper, textile and food and also it, has export market. In south and eastern India, it can
                be grown round the year but in arid zones of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab it is grown
                commercially as it can thrive in hot winds, warm temperature and drought conditions. It
                can be grown in alkaline sandy loam soil. There are many good high yielding varieties and
                strains evolved by IARI and other Research Institutes.</p>

                cool climate and prefer heavy clay soils. The plants are deep rooted and the climbing type
                needs support for growth. So staking is necessary. There are many varieties and strains;
