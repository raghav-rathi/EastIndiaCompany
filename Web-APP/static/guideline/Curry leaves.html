            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Curry leaf plays an
                important role as a condiment in the culinary preparation of South Indian dishes. It is
                cultivated in field scale in Coimbatore, Periyar, Madurai, Salem and Trichy districts of
                Tamil Nadu and in Dharward, Belgaum and Uttara Kannada of Karnataka State. The botanical
                name of the curry leaf is <i>Murrya koenigii </i>Spreng. It belongs to the family
                Rutaceae.</p>

            <h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
            <p>It does not require a
                specific climate and can come up in dry climate too. In places where minimum temperature
                goes below 13<sup>0</sup>C, the growth of shoot will be slightly affected. Though it can
                be cultivated in most of the soil types, it comes up well in light textured red soils. </p>

            <h2>Varieties</h2>
            <p>Farmer prefers local
                varieties, which have pink midrib. University of Agricultural Science, Dharwad has
                recently released two cultivars viz DWD  1 and DWD 2 which have an oil content
                of 5.22 and 4.09% respectively. Both the varieties are having strong aroma.</p>

            <h2>Preparation of field and planting</h2>
            <p>Mainfield should be
                ploughed repeatedly. Normally, a spacing of 90 to 120cm is followed on either side. One
                month before planting, pits of 30 x 30 x 30cm dimensions are dug out and are filled with
                top soil mixed with well decomposed farm yard manure at the time of planting. Healthy
                seedlings are planted in the centre of the pits. Then long furrows are formed connecting
                all the pits to facilitate easy irrigation.<br/><br/>The seedlings are
                irrigated once in five to seven days upto three years and once in 15 days afterwards. The
                field should be kept free of weeds. Normally curry leaf plants are not fertilized with
                inorganic source by the farmers. However, for a better growth and yield, each plant may be
                fertilized with 20kg of Farmyard manure besides 150g nitrogen, 25g phosphorus, and 50g of
                potash per year.</p>

            <h2>Harvesting and yield</h2>
            <p>At the end of first year, the crop comes to first harvest. The expected yield from one hectare is given below:</p>
            <table class=" table table-bordered" style="width:60%;">

            </table>
            <p>The plantation can be kept for 20 to 25 years depending upon the management practices
                followed.</p>

            <h2>Plant protection</h2>
            <p>Aphids attack the
                plant when the plants are in vegetative stage and spraying of dimethoate at the rate of
                2ml/litre of water is recommended. Leaves from such sprayed plants should not be harvested
                for 10 days lest residual toxicity of the pesticide. Leaf spots sometimes occur and
                spraying carbendazim at the rate of one gram per litre is recommended.</p>
